 Car Insurance:
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on buisness logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have beem issued.

TwentyOne:
Created a card game that I added funcitonality to it so dealers can shuffle the deck as many times as they want. If a user enters an incorrect format or a zero or even a negative number when asked to input bet and money balance and exception will be thrown and a message is customized by me to help guide the user to the playing the twentyone game or out the door if they trigger a custom fraudexception
